=head1 USAGE

=head2 put vars and functions

Statements must be delimited by certain delimiters. Variables and functions
inside the pair of delimiters has same appearance as Perl programs.

    <!-- $str -->
    <!-- &some_func('str') -->
    <!-- &some_func('str') -->
    <!-- &some_func($str) -->

As a matter of fact, The statements will be evaluated by eval function as
follows.

    $self->var('str');
    $self->func('some_func')->('str');
    $self->func('some_func')->('str');
    $self->func('some_func')->($self->var('str'));

Statements can include line breaks.

    <!-- 
        &str_envif(
            str => 'Internet Explorer is not recommended',
            key => 'USER-AGENT',
            value => 'MSIE',
        )
    -->

=head2 escape

Statement delimiter can be escaped by backslash so that the delimiter
charactors themselves appear to the output. If you want to parse the statement
after backslash, you can double escape.

    \<!-- html comment -->   ### html comment
    \\<!-- $var -->          ### A backlash and parsed value
    \\\<!-- html comment --> ### A backslash and html comment
    \\\\<!-- $var -->        ### Two backlashes and parsed value
    ....

Charactor $ and & is interpolated in any part of statements even in single
quotes. So you must escape them with '\' when it is needed. 

    <!-- &escape(str => '\$10.25') -->
